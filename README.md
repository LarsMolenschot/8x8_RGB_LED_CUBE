# 8x8_RGB_LED_CUBE
This is a personal project, the goal of the project is to create a RGB LED cube with the AA0084 RGB LED's.
A custom PCB will be designed for the cube housing a STM32 which can be programmed to display different patterns.
The PCB will include a expansion possibility to house a sd card slot with spi in the future.
